Module 7 Challenge


Purpose of this project was to utilize SQL query's to analyze an etf portfolio that consisted of 4 ETF's with equal waiting from December 2017 to December 2020.  Once the analysis took place, we can plot the results and create a web applicition VIA the Voila comman line.  

**Installations Needed**:

  import numpy as np

  import pandas as pd

  import hvplot.pandas

  import sqlalchemy

**Technology Needed**

Used the Voila library to run our Jupyter Notebook and turn it into a web application (**Added a screenshot video VIA Github directly as the video file was too large for the README file**).  

**You will need to install sqlalchemy VIA Command Line if you don't have it on your computer already.  Make sure your in the dev environment before running the command:**

conda list sqlalchemy

**to verify installation:**

conda list sqlalchemy

**You Will need to install the Voila Library VIA Command line if you don't have it on your computer already:**
